        Though they only live around the equator in Africa, many zoos are also home to mandrills today too.

        Mandrills live in groups with other primates and can have as many as 200 that they view as members of their family.

        The mandrill has sharp teeth that it will often flash as a way to warn off other animals, but it can also show its teeth as a sign of friendliness around humans and other animals.
